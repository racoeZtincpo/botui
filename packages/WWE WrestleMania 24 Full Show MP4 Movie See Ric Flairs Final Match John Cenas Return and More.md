1. **The Undertaker vs. Edge (World Heavyweight Championship)**: This was the main event of WrestleMania 24 and a classic battle between two of the best performers in WWE. The Undertaker was looking to extend his undefeated streak at WrestleMania to 16-0, while Edge was determined to retain his title and end the legend of The Phenom. The match was a back-and-forth affair that saw both men use their signature moves and counter each other's attempts to finish the match. The Undertaker survived a spear, a chair shot, and two Edgecutions, while Edge kicked out of a chokeslam, a Tombstone Piledriver, and a Last Ride. The match ended when The Undertaker locked in his Hell's Gate submission hold and forced Edge to tap out, making him the new World Heavyweight Champion and keeping his streak alive.
2. **Shawn Michaels vs. Ric Flair (Career Threatening Match)**: This was one of the most emotional matches in WWE history, as it marked the end of Ric Flair's legendary career. Mr. McMahon had given Flair an ultimatum: win or retire. Flair had managed to survive several matches against top WWE stars, but he faced his toughest challenge yet against his friend and idol, Shawn Michaels. The match was a tribute to Flair's legacy and a showcase of his skills and charisma. Flair gave it his all and showed why he was called "The Nature Boy", while Michaels showed respect and admiration for his opponent. Flair hit Michaels with a low blow, a figure-four leglock, and a chop block, while Michaels hit Flair with a flying elbow drop, a Sweet Chin Music, and a moonsault. The match ended when Michaels hesitated to deliver another Sweet Chin Music, telling Flair "I'm sorry, I love you", before kicking him in the face and pinning him for the win. Michaels hugged Flair and left the ring in tears, while Flair received a standing ovation from the fans and the WWE roster.
3. **Floyd Mayweather vs. Big Show (Boxer vs. Wrestler Match)**: This was one of the most anticipated matches in WrestleMania history, as it pitted the undefeated boxing champion Floyd Mayweather against the giant WWE superstar Big Show. The match was a result of an altercation between the two at No Way Out, where Mayweather broke Big Show's nose with a punch. The match was a David vs. Goliath scenario, as Mayweather used his speed and agility to avoid Big Show's power and size. Mayweather hit Big Show with several punches and kicks, while Big Show tossed Mayweather around like a ragdoll and tried to break his arm. The match ended when Mayweather's entourage interfered and distracted Big Show, allowing Mayweather to hit him with a steel chair and brass knuckles, knocking him out for the win.
