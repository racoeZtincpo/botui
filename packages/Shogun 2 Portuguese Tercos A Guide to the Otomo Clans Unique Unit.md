# Portuguese Tercos: The Elite Matchlock Infantry of Shogun 2
 
If you are playing as the Otomo Clan in Total War: Shogun 2, you might want to consider recruiting some Portuguese Tercos. These are unique units that can only be obtained by the Otomo Clan with their Clan DLC. They are armed with matchlocks and swords and armoured in European style, making them dangerous foes on any Japanese battlefield.

Portuguese Tercos are based on the Spanish tercio, a powerful battle formation that divided troops into thirds of matchlocks, pikes and swords. The tercio was a dominant force in European warfare in the 16th century, and was adopted by other powers, including Portugal. The Portuguese terÃ§os included the TerÃ§o of Adventurers, a unit composed of noble and gentry sons who were sent out to aid Portuguese allies.
 
In Shogun 2, Portuguese Tercos have several advantages over other matchlock units. They have better accuracy and reloading skill than Matchlock Ashigaru and Matchlock Samurai, and can even rival the hero unit Tokitaka's Tanegashima. They also have better melee stats and far better armor, allowing them to fight better in close combat than other matchlock units. They can also use the Fire by Rank and Rapid Volley abilities, which increase their firepower and rate of fire.
 
Portuguese Tercos are also easier to recruit than Matchlock Samurai, requiring only a Nanban Quarter and a Powder Maker. The Nanban Quarter can be obtained without any technological requirements, while the Powder Maker is a relatively low-tier siege building. Matchlock Samurai, on the other hand, require the late-game Gunsmith building.
 
The main drawback of Portuguese Tercos is their vulnerability to cavalry. They have no anti-cavalry skill and can be easily overrun by fast-moving horsemen. They also have fewer men per unit than melee samurai, which means they can be outnumbered by enemy infantry. Therefore, it is advisable to protect them with spearmen or other cavalry units, and to use them wisely on the battlefield.
 
Portuguese Tercos are one of the most powerful and unique units in Shogun 2. They can provide a devastating ranged advantage for the Otomo Clan, as well as a decent melee capability. They are well worth the cost and upkeep, and can help you achieve victory over your enemies.
  
## How to Use Portuguese Tercos Effectively
 
Portuguese Tercos are a versatile and powerful unit that can be used in various ways on the battlefield. Here are some tips and strategies on how to use them effectively:
 
- Use them as your main ranged unit. Portuguese Tercos have a longer range than most bow units, and can deal devastating damage with their matchlocks. They can also use the Fire by Rank and Rapid Volley abilities to increase their firepower and rate of fire. Use them to soften up enemy infantry before they reach your lines, or to support your melee units in combat.
- Protect them from cavalry. Portuguese Tercos are vulnerable to cavalry charges, especially from fast-moving light cavalry. They have no anti-cavalry skill and can be easily overrun by horsemen. Therefore, it is advisable to protect them with spearmen or other cavalry units. You can also use terrain features such as hills or forests to limit the mobility of enemy cavalry.
- Use them in sieges. Portuguese Tercos are excellent in siege battles, both on offense and defense. On offense, they can use their matchlocks to clear enemy walls and towers, or to shoot at enemy units inside the castle. On defense, they can use their matchlocks to repel enemy assaults, or to counter enemy artillery or gunpowder units.
- Upgrade them wisely. Portuguese Tercos can be upgraded with various skills and abilities that can enhance their performance. Some of the most useful ones are: Gunsmithing, which increases their accuracy and reloading skill; Armourer, which increases their armour and defense skill; Drill Square, which increases their morale and charge bonus; and Fire by Rank, which allows them to fire in three ranks instead of one.
- Build more Nanban Quarters. Portuguese Tercos are trained from Nanban Quarters, which can only be built in provinces with Christian allegiance. This limits the number of provinces where you can recruit them, unless you convert more provinces to Christianity or capture enemy Nanban Quarters. You can also use diplomacy or espionage to manipulate other clans into converting to Christianity or building Nanban Quarters for you.

Portuguese Tercos are one of the most powerful and unique units in Shogun 2. They can provide a devastating ranged advantage for the Otomo Clan, as well as a decent melee capability. They are well worth the cost and upkeep, and can help you achieve victory over your enemies.
