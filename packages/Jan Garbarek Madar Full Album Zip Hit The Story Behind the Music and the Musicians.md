Jan Garbarek was born in 1947 in Mysen, Norway, the only child of a former Polish prisoner of war and a Norwegian farmer's daughter. He grew up in Oslo, where he discovered jazz through listening to John Coltrane on the radio. He taught himself to play the saxophone and soon won a competition for amateur jazz players. He formed his own band and started to explore different styles of jazz, from bebop to free jazz. He was influenced by Don Cherry, who introduced him to world music traditions, and by Albert Ayler, who inspired him to use folk melodies in his improvisations.
 
Garbarek made his recording debut in 1967 with Til Vigdis, an album dedicated to his wife, whom he married when he was 21. He also collaborated with other Norwegian musicians, such as Terje Rypdal and Jon Christensen. In 1970, he signed with ECM Records, a German label that gave him artistic freedom and a distinctive sound. He recorded several albums for ECM, both as a leader and as a sideman for artists like Keith Jarrett, Ralph Towner, Eberhard Weber, and Egberto Gismonti. He developed a personal style that combined a sharp-edged tone, long sustained notes, and generous use of silence.
 
Garbarek also experimented with various musical genres and formats. He composed music for films, theater, and dance. He played with classical musicians, such as the Hilliard Ensemble and the Oslo Chamber Orchestra. He collaborated with world music artists, such as Anouar Brahem, Ustad Fateh Ali Khan, Zakir Hussain, and Trilok Gurtu. He explored the roots of Scandinavian folk music and the spiritual dimensions of sound. He became one of the most influential and popular saxophonists in Europe and beyond.
