- **Better communication with clients:** One of the benefits of using structured analysis is that the technique takes the clientâs needs into account from the beginning. The process of analysing and modelling the current system helps. It allows you to ask questions of the client, and gives them time to tell you about specific issues. Moreover, the visual models you create can help you explain your design choices and solutions to the client. This way, you can avoid misunderstandings and ensure customer satisfaction.
- **Higher quality of design:** Another benefit of using structured analysis is that it improves the quality of your design. By using graphs and diagrams, you can identify and eliminate errors, inconsistencies, and redundancies in your system. You can also verify that your model meets the functional and non-functional requirements of the project. Furthermore, you can use structured analysis to test and validate your model before implementing it. This can save you time and money in the long run.
- **Risk management:** One of the benefits of using structured analysis is that it challenges you to look at all aspects of a project. As a result, you analyse risks constantly. The data points out areas of contention, so you can adapt the model to them[^2^]. For example, you may have to consider environmental factors, legal regulations, or budget constraints. Structured analysis helps you to anticipate and mitigate these risks before they become problems.

As you can see, structured analysis is a powerful technique for engineers and architects. It can help you to create better models that meet your clientâs needs and expectations. It can also help you to improve your design skills and efficiency.
