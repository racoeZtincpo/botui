If you are wondering what Shiny Days is about, here is a brief overview of the game's plot and characters. Shiny Days is set in the same universe as School Days, but focuses on a different protagonist and timeline. You play as Makoto Itou, a high school student who has a crush on his classmate Kotonoha Katsura. However, things get complicated when he gets involved with several other girls, including his childhood friend Sekai Saionji, her friend Setsuna Kiyoura, and his cousin Youko Inou.
