## What to expect from Romanian cuisine
  
Romanian cuisine is a reflection of the country's geographical and cultural diversity, as well as its history of influences and adaptations. You will find dishes that are typical for certain regions, such as Moldavia, Transylvania, Wallachia, Dobrogea, or Banat, as well as dishes that are common throughout the country. You will also notice that Romanian cuisine is heavily based on meat, especially pork, but also lamb, beef, chicken, and fish. Vegetables, cereals, dairy products, and fruits are also important ingredients, often used to make soups, salads, pies, pastries, and preserves.
  
Romanian cuisine is not very spicy, but it uses a variety of herbs and spices to enhance the flavor of the dishes. Some of the most common ones are parsley, dill, thyme, bay leaf, garlic, onion, pepper, paprika, and caraway seeds. Romanian cuisine also has a distinct sour taste, which comes from the use of vinegar, lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, or fermented wheat bran (borÈ) in many dishes. Another characteristic of Romanian cuisine is the generous use of animal fat, such as lard, butter, or sour cream, which adds richness and creaminess to the dishes.
  
## How to start your Romanian meal
  
Romanian meals traditionally begin with a soup, often a 'sour' one called ciorbÄ. The sourness derives from vinegar, lemon juice, sauerkraut juice (zeamÄ de varzÄ), or fermented wheat bran extract (borÈ) added during preparation. The local favorite - don't be afraid - is ciorbÄ de burtÄ[^2^], tripe soup made from cow's innards and flavored with garlic. Other popular soups are ciorbÄ de periÈoare (meatball soup), ciorbÄ de fasole (bean soup), ciorbÄ de legume (vegetable soup), or ciorbÄ de peÈte (fish soup).
  
Another way to start your meal is with an appetizer called aperitiv or gustare. This usually consists of cold cuts of meat (such as ham, salami, or pastrami), cheese (such as telemea - a salty white cheese similar to feta - or caÈcaval - a yellow semi-hard cheese similar to cheddar), eggs (boiled or stuffed), vegetables (such as tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, or pickles), and bread. Sometimes you can also find more elaborate appetizers such as drob de miel[^1^] (a dish made with lamb offals, eggs, green onions, bread dipped in milk and herbs), zacuscÄ (a vegetable spread made with roasted eggplant and peppers), or icre (fish roe salad).
