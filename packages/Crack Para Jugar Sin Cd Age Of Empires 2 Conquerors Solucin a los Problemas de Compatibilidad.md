ETS is the organization that creates and administers the TOEFL iBT test, which measures the English language skills of non-native speakers. Sometimes, ETS uses test forms that do not include all the four sections of the test: reading, listening, speaking, and writing. When this happens, the test takers only receive scores for the sections that they completed, and they do not get a total test score that combines all the sections. This type of score report is different from the usual one, and it may cause some confusion or questions. If you receive this type of report and you want to know more about the reasons behind this decision, please contact the person who took the test and ask them for more details.
