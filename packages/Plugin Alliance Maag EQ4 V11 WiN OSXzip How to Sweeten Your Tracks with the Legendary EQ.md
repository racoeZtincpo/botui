The Maag EQ4 plugin is available for both Windows and Mac OS X, and it comes in VST, AU, AAX and RTAS formats.
 
The Maag EQ4 plugin has a simple and intuitive interface that consists of six knobs, each controlling a different frequency band. The first five bands are fixed, while the sixth band is a variable air band that can boost frequencies from 2.5 kHz to 40 kHz. The air band is the signature feature of the Maag EQ4, as it adds a subtle and smooth brightness to the sound without harshness or artifacts. The plugin also has an input gain knob, an output gain knob, a bypass switch and a link switch that links the left and right channels.
