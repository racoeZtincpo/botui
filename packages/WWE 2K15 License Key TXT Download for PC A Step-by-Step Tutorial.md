I attempted to copy the file from a USB stick and transfer the license to the destination PC using the "Automation license manager" software. However, I encountered an error message that said "None or not all license keys transferred." When I checked the detailed view, I saw another message that said License key SISLWCRT031300 (10411000560141470751) is corrupt (c3). There was also a red cross symbol on the license side.
