The Sicam SBM 100s 200s are machines designed and built for balancing the wheels of cars, vans, and motorcycles[^1^]. They are easy to use, fast, and precise. They can measure the imbalance of the wheel in grams or ounces, and display the correction weight and position on a digital display. They also have an automatic brake system that stops the wheel rotation when the balancing cycle is completed.
  
In this article, we will show you how to use the Sicam SBM 100s 200s wheel balancers step by step. We will also provide you with some tips and tricks to get the best results from your wheel balancing. Whether you are a professional mechanic or a DIY enthusiast, this guide will help you get the most out of your Sicam SBM 100s 200s wheel balancers.
  
## Step 1: Mounting the Wheel on the Balancer
  
The first step is to mount the wheel on the balancer. You will need to use the appropriate adapter and accessories depending on the type and size of the wheel. The Sicam SBM 100s 200s come with a standard cone set that can fit most car and motorcycle wheels[^2^]. However, you may need to purchase additional adapters for some special wheels, such as alloy rims or low-profile tires.

To mount the wheel on the balancer, follow these steps:
  
1. Remove any dirt or debris from the wheel hub and rim.
2. Select the suitable cone and spacer for the wheel hub diameter.
3. Place the cone on the shaft of the balancer and secure it with the quick nut.
4. Place the spacer on the cone if needed.
5. Lift the wheel and slide it onto the cone until it rests against the spacer.
6. Tighten the quick nut by hand until it clamps the wheel firmly.
7. Check that the wheel is centered and aligned on the balancer.

## Step 2: Entering the Wheel Data
  
The next step is to enter the wheel data into the balancer. You will need to measure and input three parameters: the rim diameter (D), the rim width (W), and the distance between the machine and the inside edge of the rim (A). These parameters are essential for calculating the correct weight and position for balancing.
  
To enter the wheel data into the balancer, follow these steps:

1. Measure the rim diameter (D) in inches or millimeters using a caliper or a tape measure. The rim diameter is equal to the tire size minus twice the tire height. For example, if your tire size is 205/55 R16, then your rim diameter is 16 inches.
2. Measure the rim width (W) in inches or millimeters using a caliper or a tape measure. The rim width is equal to the distance between the inner edges of
the rim flanges. For example, if your rim width is marked as 6J, then your rim width is 6 inches.
3. Measure
the distance between
the machine
and
the inside edge
of
the rim (A) in millimeters using
the gauge provided with
the balancer. The distance A is equal to
the offset
of
the wheel from
the centerline
of
the balancer shaft. For example,
if your distance A is marked as ET40,
then your distance A is 40 millimeters.
4. Press
the D button on
the keypad
of
the balancer
and enter
the rim diameter value using
the numeric keys. Press
the ENTER button to confirm.
5. Press
the W button on
the keypad
