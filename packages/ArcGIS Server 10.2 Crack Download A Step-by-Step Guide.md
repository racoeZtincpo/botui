## Step 1: Prepare ArcGIS Server for installation
 
Before you install ArcGIS Server, you need to do some preparations:
 
- Obtain an authorization file for the machine on which you're installing ArcGIS Server. You can request an authorization file from Esri Customer Service or your local distributor.
- Verify that your machine meets the system requirements for ArcGIS Server. You can check the system requirements here: [https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/install/windows/system-requirements.htm](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/install/windows/system-requirements.htm)
- Sign in as a user with administrative privileges.
- Close all applications on your machine.
- Browse to the folder containing the downloaded ArcGIS Server setup. You can download ArcGIS Server from here: [http://appsforms.esri.com/products/download/](http://appsforms.esri.com/products/download/)

## Step 2: Install ArcGIS Server
 
Now you are ready to install ArcGIS Server:

1. Browse to the location of the setup files and double-click Setup.exe.
2. During the installation, read the master agreement and accept it, or close the window if you do not agree with the terms.
3. The setup program displays the features that will be installed. You can choose to install GIS Server, which hosts GIS services that can be accessed through REST and SOAP, and .NET Extension Support, which supports the development and deployment of .NET server object extensions (SOEs) and server object interceptors (SOIs). The .NET Extension Support feature is optional and requires Microsoft .NET Framework.
4. Specify the account to be used by ArcGIS Server to perform a variety of functions. You can specify a local account, a domain account, or a Managed Service Account. The default account name is arcgis. For more information about the ArcGIS Server account, see here: [https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/install/windows/the-arcgis-server-account.htm](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/install/windows/the-arcgis-server-account.htm)
5. Specify the installation location for ArcGIS Server. The default location is C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Server.
6. Click Next to proceed with the installation.
7. When the installation is complete, click Finish to close the setup program.

## Step 3: Configure ArcGIS Server
 
After you install ArcGIS Server, you need to configure it:

- Create a site or join an existing site. A site is a collection of one or more machines that run ArcGIS Server and share GIS services. You can create a site using ArcGIS Server Manager, a web-based application that allows you to administer ArcGIS Server. To access ArcGIS Server Manager, open a web browser and enter http://<machine name="">:6080/arcgis/manager in the address bar. For more information about creating or joining a site, see here: <a href="https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/install/windows/create-a-site-or-join-an-existing-site.htm">https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/install/windows/create-a-site-or-join-an-existing-site.htm</a></machine>
- Authorize ArcGIS Server using the authorization file that you obtained earlier. You can authorize ArcGIS Server using ArcGIS Server Manager or the Software Authorization Wizard. For more information about authorizing ArcGIS Server, see here: [https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/install/windows/authorize-arcgis-server.htm](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/install/windows/authorize-arcgis-server.htm)
