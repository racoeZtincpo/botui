The film is based on an original script by Carlos Contreras, the brother of the director Ernesto Contreras. The brothers have collaborated before on Blue Eyelids and other projects. In an interview with Reves Online[^3^], Ernesto Contreras said that the script was inspired by a personal experience of his brother, who had a brief but intense affair with a married woman. He also said that he wanted to make a film that was different from the typical Mexican romantic comedy or melodrama, and that he aimed to create a realistic and honest portrait of human emotions.
 
The film also features the collaboration of other talented Mexican artists, such as cinematographer Tonatiuh MartÃ­nez, composer Alejandro CastaÃ±os and editor Jorge Macaya. The film was shot in Mexico City, using mostly natural light and handheld camera. The film also has a distinctive sound design, which mixes ambient noises with electronic music and sound effects. The film also uses some visual metaphors, such as the photocopier machine and the water pipes, to represent the characters' inner states.
 
In another interview with YouTube, the actors Cecilia SuÃ¡rez, JosÃ© MarÃ­a Yazpik and Irene Azuela talked about their experience working on the film. They said that they felt very comfortable and free with the director, who gave them space to improvise and explore their characters. They also said that they had a lot of chemistry and trust among them, which helped them to perform the intimate scenes. They also praised the script for being well-written and realistic.
