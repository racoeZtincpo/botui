Of course, playing FIFA World Cup 2014 on PC is not the same as watching the actual tournament on TV or live. The World Cup 2014 was one of the most memorable and exciting events in football history, with many unforgettable moments and goals. Here are some of the highlights of the tournament that you can relive on YouTube or FIFA+.
 
One of the most controversial moments of the World Cup 2014 was the penalty awarded to Brazil in their opening match against Croatia. The referee judged that Croatian defender Dejan Lovren fouled Brazilian striker Fred in the box, but replays showed that Fred fell down without much contact. Neymar converted the penalty to give Brazil a 2-1 lead, and they went on to win 3-1. The decision sparked outrage among Croatian players and fans, and raised questions about the fairness of the tournament[^1^].
 
Another shocking moment was the blunder by Russian goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev in their match against South Korea. Akinfeev failed to catch a long-range shot by Lee Keun-Ho and let it slip through his hands into the net. The goal gave South Korea a 1-0 lead in the 68th minute, but Russia equalized six minutes later through Aleksandr Kerzhakov. The match ended in a 1-1 draw, which proved costly for Russia as they failed to advance from their group[^3^].
 
One of the most spectacular goals of the World Cup 2014 was scored by James Rodriguez of Colombia in their quarter-final match against Uruguay. Rodriguez chested down a long pass from Abel Aguilar and volleyed it from outside the box into the top corner of the net. The goal was voted as the best goal of the tournament by FIFA.com users, and Rodriguez won the Golden Boot award as the top scorer with six goals[^1^].
